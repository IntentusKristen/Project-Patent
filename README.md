# Project-Patent
This project is made to understand the similarities and differences between various different patent classifications for the same patents. 
Additionally, correlations between variables such as patent classification type, nominal value of patent, real value of patent, cites, issue date, and filing date are explored and visualized to draw insights and conclusions from the data.
